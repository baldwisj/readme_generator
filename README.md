  ## Description

  This application was created with the knowledge of node.js that we have covered so far in the bootcamp. The largest factors of success though my eyes are the implementation of correct arrow function syntax, my use of template literals, ability to properly write/append files using js, use of switch case functions, and proper use of inquirer and npm packages. 


  ## Installation

  To install this application, the user will have to clone the code from the repository into their local storage, as well as the node.js functionality. Upon its successful cloning, the user will just need to enter ‘node index.js’ into the terminal to initiate the application.


  ## Usage

  This application was created to quickly and efficiently create a quality readme file using terminal prompts. Users will be presented with a prompt for each section to fill out. They will also be prese3nted with a choice of licenses that, when selected and rendered on the page, will display the corresponding badge and link associated with that license. The user will need to install the application and node.js.


  


  ## Contribution

  To further contribute to this application, users will need to clone the code and push to the repository when contributions are completed.


  ## Test

  The README currently displayed is the test and product of the application.
